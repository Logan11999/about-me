## About
This repo will be used to inform about myself as well as about the tools and resources used in class.
## Recommended Tools
The first tool you will need would be a web browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Then a github account aside from those maybe a markdown cheatsheet would be helpful.

- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
