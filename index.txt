Logan 1

I am a Senior working on my bachelors degree in  Computer Science.

I am from Gower, Missouri where I attended East Buchanan High School. Sadly this environments best computer classes were learning word and such.  Having a love for technology and computers I came to northwest and have enjoyed coding since I first learned it in Programming 1. I haven't had as much luck in getting internships as I would like but I am always looking for opportunities to improve and practice my coding.

As for work I have always been interested in making video games but more on an indie scene as the horror stories of game development under large companies I have heard. Aside from that I have enjoyed app development for IOS or Android. Databases have always made sense to me so that could also be an option.

I guess the amount of stories I read is interesting I watch various shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, and others. Also read books, manga, light novels, and various different translated novels.
